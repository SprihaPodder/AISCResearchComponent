Autonomous vehicles operate in complex, unpredictable environments: sensor readings may be noisy, weather conditions change rapidly, and humans on the road behave in ways that are hard to model precisely. Traditional algorithms struggle when faced with this uncertainty because they rely on exact input data and rigid rules. So playing it fuzzy!
